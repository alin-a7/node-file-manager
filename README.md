# node-file-manager

The file manager able to do the following:

- Work using CLI
- Perform basic file operations (copy, move, delete, rename, etc.)
- Utilize Streams API
- Get information about the host machine operating system
- Perform hash calculations
- Compress and decompress files

## Getting Started

1. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run start --username=your_username
```
2. Use following commands
  - #### Navigation & working directory
    - Go upper from current directory 
    ```bash
    up
    ```
    - Go to dedicated folder from current directory (`path_to_directory` can be relative or absolute)
    ```bash
    cd path_to_directory
    ```
    - Print in console list of all files and folders in current directory:
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
 - #### Basic operations with files
    - Read file and print it's content in console: 
    ```bash
    cat path_to_file
    ```
    - Create empty file in current working directory: 
    ```bash
    add new_file_name
    ```
    - Create new directory in current working directory: 
    ```bash
    mkdir new_directory_name
    ```
    - Rename file: 
    ```bash
    rn path_to_file new_filename
    ```
    - Copy file: 
    ```bash
    cp path_to_file path_to_new_directory
    ```
    - Move file: 
    ```bash
    mv path_to_file path_to_new_directory
    ```
    - Delete file: 
    ```bash
    rm path_to_file
    ```
 - #### Operating system info
    - Get EOL (default system End-Of-Line) and print it to console  
    ```bash
    os --EOL
    ```
    - Get host machine CPUs info (overall amount of CPUS plus model and clock rate (in GHz) for each of them) and print it to console  
    ```bash
    os --cpus
    ```
    - Get home directory and print it to console  
    ```bash
    os --homedir
    ```
    - Get current *system user name* and print it to console  
    ```bash
    os --username
    ```
    - Get CPU architecture for which Node.js binary has compiled and print it to console  
    ```bash
    os --architecture
    ```
 - #### Hash calculation  
    - Calculate hash for file and print it into console  
    ```bash
    hash path_to_file
    ```
 - #### Compress and decompress operations  
    - Compress file 
    ```bash
    compress path_to_file path_to_destination
    ```
    - Decompress file
    ```bash
    decompress path_to_file path_to_destination
    ```
